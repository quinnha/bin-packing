# bin-packing

Given some bins and some objects, what's the best way to pack all the bins so that all the objects fit? This project implements some offline and online algorithms, and benchmark each's performance, to determine which algorithm is best for which dataset. Tests/becnhamrks can be found under report.ipynb!
